## Data Science Challenge
At Frontier, our customers depend on us to deliver blazing-fast, reliable internet. We’re looking for ways to solve connectivity problems before our customers even know they have them. 
<br><br>Your challenge is to help us predict when a customer may be having a bad experience and call us or need us to visit them for a support call. 
<br><br>This will include using AI and applying data from our network, along with any other data you think is valuable.
<br><br>You can find details of this challenge [here](./Data_Challenge/)
## Materials Challenge
Frontier is committed to sustainability in our technology. That means our equipment must work in all kinds of environments and situations. 
<br><br>Your challenge is to help us design an enclosure that keeps our equipment cool during hot Texas summers. 
<br><br>The best design will be inexpensive, self-powered (or not powered at all!), and have few moving parts. Your design can be built with real materials or in the CAD software of your choosing.
